# Fresno: The Seven5 Tutorial

This tutorial builds a blog engine called Fresno. The world does not need
more blog engines; Seven5 needs a tutorial based around an application
that has the minimal amount of application-specific things for you to learn.

## Typography in this document

This document writes commands that you type like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls -l /
{% endhighlight %}

The dollar sign is used to indicate you should type the command at the
shell.  In cases where we are referring to a file that is part of the
tutorial we will write it like this `somefile.go`.  We also will indicate
environment variables the same way (`PAGER`).

Meta-information and commentary about the tutorial itself is written like
this:

> We would love to have somebody test out this tutorial on windows
> and provide a pull request with the necessary changes to get it working.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you understand go and the web fairly well and
have some experience with git.  Further, this tutorial
assumes you are developing on a Mac using OSX or a similar-enough Linux
installation.
